# Simple Web Scraper
This project is a simple web scraping project that retrieves information from the homepage of Reuters, a well-known news agency. It uses Python and popular libraries like requests and beautifulsoup4 to access the Reuters homepage, extract the HTML code, and parse it to extract the first 5 headlines from the page.
